# Introduction

Welcome to the TxtMS API! You can use our API to access TxtMS API endpoints, which can get and post leads/orders, make text messages via WhatsApp, SMS and Fax.

We have language bindings in Shell, Ruby. You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.


# Authentication

> To post orders/leads and send sms, whatsApp for fax messages

```ruby
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
TODO: fix the example
API_URL = 'http://www.txtms.de/api/v1/orders'


 conn = Faraday.new(url: API_URL) do |faraday|
    faraday.request  :url_encoded
    faraday.adapter  Faraday.default_adapter
  end

  conn.basic_auth(API_BASIC_AUTH_USER, API_BASIC_AUTH_PASS)

  response = conn.post do |req|
    req.url "/orders"
    req.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/json'
    req.body = order.to_json
  end

  response
```


```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"title":"test order2","description":"Your order description","account_id":1,"template_id":1,"data":{"image":"order.jpg","comments":"extra information"},"category":"general","delivery":"sms","repeat":"monthly","duration":"3","dispatch_time":"25/10/2018 13:00","expires_at":"30/10/2018","contact_id":1}' http://www.txtms.de/api/v1/orders
```


> Make sure to replace `API_KEY` with your API key.

TxtMS uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new TxtMS API key at our [Account Area](http://txtms.de/accounts).

Txtms expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.

# Kittens
